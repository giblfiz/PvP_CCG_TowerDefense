**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** May 1, 2025

This document outlines initial brainstorming concepts for Towers and Mooks for each Faction/Flavor combination. Mechanics described are preliminary ideas.

---

## Faction: WW2

### WW2 / Psionic
* **Tower: Propaganda Tower**
    * *Mechanic:* Emits an aura causing enemy mooks within range to have a chance to become confused (attack other mooks or walk backwards) temporarily. (Counter: Atomic)
* **Mook: PsyOps Officer**
    * *Mechanic:* A support mook. Nearby friendly mooks gain resistance to enemy Psionic effects (confusion, freeze, control). Does not attack.

### WW2 / Atomic
* **Tower: Artillery Spotter**
    * *Mechanic:* Does not attack directly. Unlocks a player-activated "Artillery Barrage" spell (long cooldown, consumes ammo) dealing heavy Atomic damage in a target area. (Counter: Impact)
* **Mook: Irradiated Engineer**
    * *Mechanic:* Tough ground unit. Upon death, creates a small, short-lived Atomic damage aura. May slowly repair nearby friendly WW2 towers.

### WW2 / Impact
* **Tower: Machine Gun Nest**
    * *Mechanic:* Standard rapid-fire tower dealing direct Impact damage to ground targets. Consumes ammo quickly. (Counter: Psionic)
* **Tower: Tank Trap**
    * *Mechanic:* Cheap ground obstacle. Slows ground mooks that pass over it and deals minor Impact damage. Can be destroyed.
* **Mook: GI Grunt**
    * *Mechanic:* Basic ground trooper with moderate HP and Impact damage. Spawns in numbers.
* **Mook: Tank**
    * *Mechanic:* Slow, heavily armored ground unit with a powerful cannon (Impact). High HP, resistant to Impact damage.

## Faction: B-Movie Horror

### Horror / Psionic
* **Tower: Hypno-Crystal**
    * *Mechanic:* Single-target tower that "freezes" an enemy mook or tower in place for a short duration. Prioritizes high-threat targets. (Counter: Atomic)
* **Mook: Floating Brain**
    * *Mechanic:* Slow flying mook. Gets close to a tower and channels, draining its ammo or temporarily disabling it. Low HP.

### Horror / Atomic
* **Tower: Radiation Pit**
    * *Mechanic:* Creates a persistent damaging Atomic aura on the ground around it. Does not target directly. Effective vs ground swarms. (Counter: Impact)
* **Mook: The Blob**
    * *Mechanic:* Slow-moving ground mook. Deals Atomic damage to adjacent units/towers. May split into smaller Blobs upon taking enough damage.

### Horror / Impact
* **Tower: Spitter Plant**
    * *Mechanic:* Lobs projectiles dealing Impact damage, potentially with a slowing effect. Can hit ground and (maybe) low-flying units. (Counter: Psionic)
* **Mook: Giant Ant**
    * *Mechanic:* Fast-moving, low HP ground swarm unit with melee Impact damage.
* **Mook: Werewolf**
    * *Mechanic:* Fast melee attacker with high Impact damage and lifesteal. May have brief periods of higher speed/damage.

## Faction: 50s Sci-Fi Aliens

### Aliens / Psionic
* **Tower: Mind Control Spire**
    * *Mechanic:* Single-target tower that attempts to permanently convert an enemy mook to fight for the player. Fails against stronger mooks or those with Psionic resistance. (Counter: Atomic)
* **Mook: Grey Alien Commander**
    * *Mechanic:* Support mook. Provides an intermittent Psionic shield to nearby friendly Alien mooks, blocking one instance of damage or one negative effect.

### Aliens / Atomic
* **Tower: Ray Gun Turret**
    * *Mechanic:* Standard ranged tower firing Atomic energy blasts. Good baseline damage and range. (Counter: Impact)
* **Mook: Alien Grunt**
    * *Mechanic:* Basic ranged trooper firing weak Atomic blasts.
* **Mook: Flying Saucer**
    * *Mechanic:* Flying unit that periodically drops small Atomic bombs on ground targets below it.

### Aliens / Impact
* **Tower: Force Field Emitter**
    * *Mechanic:* Projects a temporary barrier that blocks enemy mook movement and projectiles for a short duration. Has a cooldown. Requires power/ammo. (Counter: Psionic)
* **Mook: Clunky Robot**
    * *Mechanic:* Slow, heavily armored ground unit with strong melee Impact attacks. Very resistant to Impact damage.
